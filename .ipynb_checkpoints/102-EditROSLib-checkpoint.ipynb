    "Next we define the various classes that we called in CreateLib.  The first one is the one that drives a distance at a speed - note that we pass in the name of the Create when we initialize the class instance and then if you do not provide a distance and speed, we default to 0.5 and 0.15.  We have a few methods - we set the goal by calling *_action.send_goal_async*, which is defined in *Node* and we define which callback to call when the goal is accepted.  The next step is to say what to do when that callback is called - hence *goal_request_callback* - where we report back (logger) if it was accepted and then use the goal handle that was sent back to set another callback for when the goal is reached (*self.get_result_callback*).
