    "<h1>Beginning ROS2</h1>ROS2 is similar to MQTT in that you publish and subscribe to send messages over TCP/IP. However, in this case there is no broker as it only looks for other ROS nodes on the same LAN (local area network). You can go outside your network by saving a config file with the appropriate IP addresses."

This line says that you are going to publish once a topic called \"chatter\" and send the string (a standard message type) \"Hello\".

An action is the same thing only it is for things that take a little longer.  So it has three states (and two callbacks): *Resquest*, *Result*, and *Feedback*.  The request is what you send to the robot - and when it is done you get back a result - however you can, at any time, ask the robot how close it is to the goal with the feedback parameter."
