    "The goal with this activity is to control your Create from your smartphone by writing an app using [Thunkables](https://thunkable.com/#/) connecting to the cloud ([Airtable](https://www.ceeoinnovations.org/telerobotics-workshop/img/Airtable_Step_by_Step.pdf)).  You will demonstrate your remote control skills by racing past obstacles in the classroom.  First go set up your own airtable account and make a set of fields for the twist that you can change from your app.  Then make a Thunkable app that will change the values of those fields.  In class, we will write some code that will have the Create read those fields every sec or two and twist accordingly."
