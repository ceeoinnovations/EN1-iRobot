    "The goal with this activity is to write your own ROS code.  You will demonstrate your coding prowess by having the creates line up and stay a constant distance from each other.  Basically you will write a proportional controller - one that continually reads the proximity sensor (*d(t)*) and continually updates the forward speed (*X(t)*) proportional to the distance between creates (*d(t)*) (minus the desired spacing - *s*).  So $$X(t) = K_p * (d(t) - s)$$"
