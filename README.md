 Here is where you can find all of the JupyterLabs for class.  To get these to work on your system, you will either have to use our networked Hub, or:
 1. install VMware (there is a free version - and there is a version for M1 macs)
 2. download and run Briana's VMWare image
 3. set up WiFi (see [Kate's](https://katewujciak1.wixsite.com/projectcreate/parallels) website)
 4. install jupyterlabs  (pip3 install jupyterlab)
 5. download everything on this site as a zip
 6. unzip it all and stick it in a useful folder somewhere
 7. navigate to that folder in the Terminal
 8. type jupyter-lab
 9. double click on 00-Getting Started 
 10. and go to town.

I would recommend just using the networked Hub an doing absolutely no installation yourself.
